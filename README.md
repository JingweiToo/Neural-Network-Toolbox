# Simple-Neural-Networks-with-K-fold-Cross-Validation-Manner
This toolbox contains six type of neural networks (1) Artificial neural network (ANN) (2) Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) (3) Cascade Forward Neural Network (CFNN) (4) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (5) Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) (6) Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)  The "Main" script shows the examples of how to use these neural network programs with the benchmark data set.  The displayed results include: (1) Accuracy for each fold in k-fold cross-validation (2) Average accuracy over k-folds (3) Confusion matrix.
